# Dynamic Lights

Our open source desktop application allows multimedia artists
and students to easily and quickly experiment with life-like processes
via a graphical interface to generate dynamic, emergent
and self-organizing patterns and output these patterns via OSC
and MIDI to control light, sound, video, or even robots in real time,
unlike systems that are fixed such as timelines and cue systems.

This project is a work in progress.
