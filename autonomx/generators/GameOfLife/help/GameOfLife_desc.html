<h2>Wolfram Cellular Automata Description</h2>

<p>Wolfram's rules for cellular automata, also known as the Wolfram Code, is a classification system used to describe rulesets for one-dimensional automata.</p>
<p>First described by Stephen Wolfram in a 1983 paper and further detailed in his book <i>A New Kind of Science</i>, Wolfram lays out 256 unique rulesets describing particular behaviour of cellular automata.</p>
<p>The new state of each individual automaton is determined by a function of the states of the other automata in the same neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The function for describing particular rulesets can be described as the following (taken from Wikipedia):</p>
<li>List all the S<sup>2n + 1</sup> possible state configurations of the neighbourhood of a given cell.</li>
<li>Interpreting each configuration as a number as described above, sort them in descending numerical order.</li>
<li>For each configuration, list the state which the given cell will have, according to this rule, on the next iteration.</li>
<li>Interpret the resulting list of states again as an S-ary number, and convert this number to decimal. The resulting decimal number is the Wolfram code.</li>
