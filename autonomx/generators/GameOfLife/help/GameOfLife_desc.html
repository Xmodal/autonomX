<h2>Conway's Game of Life Description</h2>

<p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's evolution is determined by its initial state (also known as the intial seed) with no requirement of further input.</p>
<p>The universe of the Game of Life is mostly visualized on a two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which can have the two possible states - live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).</p>
<p>Here in AutonomX such a state is described by a white cell (live) or a black (dead). In each iteration (also known as a generation) every cell interacts with its eight neighbors horizontally, diagonally adjacent, and vertically resulting into another set of live or dead cells in the next generation.</p>
<p>While there can be many patterns possible in the Game of Life based on the initial seed, the current version of AutonomX provides the Random, Glider, SpaceShip, RpentoMino, and PentaDecathlon as some common patterns to explore.</p>
<p>The lattice is considered to a folded lattice abstractly so that the cells on the extreme left and extreme right can consider the cells on extreme right and extreme left respectively as their neighbors too.</p>
<p>The rules for describing whether a cell should be alive or dead in the next iteration is determined by the following (taken from Wikipedia):</p>
<li>Any <i>live</i> cell with fewer than two live neighbours <i>dies</i>, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any <i>live</i>  cell with two or three live neighbours <i>lives</i> on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any <i>live</i>  cell with more than three live neighbours <i>dies</i>, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any <i>dead</i>  cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a <i>live</i>  cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
