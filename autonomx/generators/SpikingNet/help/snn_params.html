<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul type="bullet">
    <li><b>General</b><ul><li><b>Width</b>: width (in neurons) of the network</li><li><b>Height</b>: heights (in neurons) oh the network</li><li><b>Time scale</b>: corresponds to the speed of the network. This is expressed as a ratio relative to the speed at which biological neurons would fire.</li></ul></li>
    <li><b>Neuron Behaviors</b><br>SNN are constituted of excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. While excitatory neurons increase the electric potential of other neurons when they fire, the inhibitory neurons decrease the electric potential of other neurons.<ul><li><b>Inh. Portion</b>: ratio of neurons that are inhibitory neurons (the rest of the networks consists of excitatory neurons).</li><li><b>Inh. Neuron Noise</b>: amount of noise added to the electrical potential of the neuron.</li><li><b>Exc. Neuron Noise</b>: amount of noise added to the electrical potential of the neuron.</li><li><b>Inh. Neuron Type</b>: type of the inhibitory neurons (spiking, chattering, resonator).</li><li><b>Exc. Neuron Type</b>: type of the excitatory neurons (spiking, chattering, resonator).</li></ul></li>
    <li><b>Learning</b><ul><li><b>STP strength</b>: Short-Term synaptic Plasticity, it corresponds to the evolution of the synaptic connection between neurons in relation to the recent activity of the firing neurons.</li><li><b>STDP strength</b>: Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity, it corresponds to the long-term evolution of the synaptic connection between neurons in relation to when they fire: “neurons that fire together connect together.” This corresponds to the ability of the network to develop a long-term memory.</li><li><b>Decay half life</b>: corresponds to the amount of time needed for a connection to decay to half its initial strength</li></ul></li>
