<p><b>Spiking neural networks (SNNs)</b> are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks. In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not fire at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks), but rather fire only when a membrane potential – an intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge – reaches a specific value. When a neuron fires, it generates a signal that travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in accordance with this signal.<br></p>
<p>In the context of spiking neural networks, the current activation level (modeled as a differential equation) is normally considered to be the neuron's state, with incoming spikes pushing this value higher, eventually either firing or decaying. Various coding methods exist for interpreting the outgoing spike train as a real-value number, relying on either the frequency of spikes, or the interval between spikes, to encode information.<br></p>
