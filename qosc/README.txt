Prototype of using Oscpack with Qt5.

Released in the public domain.

Oscpack is distributed under the MIT open source license
(the files in the osc/ directory)

Note: The contents of this directory is currently not
build as a .pro SUBDIR in this project. Instead, we simply
use the .cpp and .h files directly, and build them as needed in
each other .pro projects.
